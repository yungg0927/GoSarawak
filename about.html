                <p>I was responsible for building the overall HTML structure of the website. This included creating a navigation bar and footer that appeared consistently on all pages to allow users to navigate the site smoothly. I focused on writing clean and easy-to-understand HTML code to ensure that the website was well-structured and accessible. In addition to the website structure, I was responsible for designing and implementing the homepage, and was responsible for HTML layout and CSS styling. My goal was to create a clear and easy-to-use interface that would leave a strong first impression on visitors. Through this experience, I became more confident in using HTML and CSS in real projects, and also improved my skills in layout planning, visual hierarchy, and responsive design.</p>

                <p>In this project, I was primarily responsible for the Destination Highlights section of the website. This section consists of three themed pages: Cities, Nature, and Adventure. I conducted research, collected relevant information, and carefully organized the content to make each page informative and visually appealing. In addition, I designed the CSS for the Feedback section to ensure it was user-friendly and responsive across different devices. I was also responsible for all images used in the website, including selecting high-quality visuals, writing descriptions, and arranging images in a way that enhanced the overall aesthetic and user experience. Through these efforts, I improved my front-end design skills and gained a deeper understanding of visual storytelling, content organization, and user experience design.</p>
